# GoFish_Ajuwon_etal_2022
Bonsai code for running visual discrimination learning, reversal, and choice experiments in goldfish using the GoFish platform.To run our worklfows (main task and training), users need to set the location of trial lists and a white noise image used in early training. Examples of each of these are provided. To help navigating our workflow we have included a PDF with annoted screenshots.
